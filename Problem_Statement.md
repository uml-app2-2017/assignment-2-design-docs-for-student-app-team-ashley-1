# Problem Statement

Many college students have trouble keeping up with all of the assignments they are given every semester, and some just can't find the motivation to get them all done in time. With the *Reward Roster* app, students are given incentive to complete their assignments as early as possible. Students simply enter their assignments into the app along with the due date. At the end of each month, if a student has completed at least 80% of their assignments on time, they are awarded 5 coupons for on-campus dining locations so that they can reward themselves with discounted snacks after all their hard work.
