# Problem Statement

Many college students have trouble keeping up with all of the assignments they are given every semester, and some just can't find the motivation to get them all done in time. With the *Reward Roster* app, students are given incentive to complete their assignments as early as possible. Students simply enter their assignments into the app along with the due date, and then assign a level of importance to the assignment on a scale of 1-5. When a student completes an assignment and marks it down in the app, they are given a certain amount of "points" for completing it based on the importance level and how far ahead of the due date they completed it. Once a certain milestone of points is achieved, the student is given a coupon for one of the participating restaurants near campus so they can reward themselves with some discounted snacks after all their hard work.
