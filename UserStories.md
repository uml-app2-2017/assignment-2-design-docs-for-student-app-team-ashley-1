Student Developers
------------------
The **Student Developers** need some **testers** for an Android app that they are 
creating. They post **ads** on local campus bullitin boards and social media sites 
asking students if they want **incentives** to **complete their assignments**. 
The first week they receive 20 students requesting to test their app. They 
meet and **interview** the students to determine which would be the best testers 
for their app. For each month the testers that complete 80% or more of their 
assignments while using the app are **rewarded** five food coupons to on-campus 
dining over a total of three months.

Amanda
------
Amanda is testing the app to hopefully change her bad habits and get more 
assignments in on time. She finds out about the app from a friend that tagged 
her to a **post** about the app. She **contacts** the student developers in order to 
test the app. She sets up an interview with the developers, giving them a 
**summary** of her habits as a student. After a month she notices that she is 
completing more of her assingments. Amanda realizes that with a little 
**motivation** she is more likely to complete her assignments. She is rewarded 
with 15 food coupons for completing at least 80% of her asssignments each month.
